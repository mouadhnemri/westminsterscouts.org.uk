  Explorers are the fourth section of the Scouting movement.
  Right from the time of Baden-Powell, there have been arrangements for young people who wanted to continue after their time in the Scout Section,
  and in 1967, Venture Scouts were formed from the existing Senior Scout and Rover Scout Sections.
