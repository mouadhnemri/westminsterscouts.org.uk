  Coombe Farm offers indoor accommodation for 20 Cubs or Scouts along with a toilet and shower block. 
  If, however, you wish to hold a Troop or Patrol camp then there are plenty of camping areas available. 
  The Farm also provides the perfect place to hold your Patrol Camps as it is great for wide games, fire-lighting, backwoods cooking, etc.
