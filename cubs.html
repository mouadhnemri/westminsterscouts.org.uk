  Cubs take part in a wide range of activities that are designed to be interesting and to challenge 
  them. At the same time they have fun, adventure and make friends along the way. They do this 
  through taking part in a programme of activities provided by the Leadership team  such  as: 
  camping, playing games, trying new things and exploring the outdoors.
