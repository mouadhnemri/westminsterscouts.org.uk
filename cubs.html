  Cubs take part in a wide range of activities that are designed to be interesting and to challenge
  them. At the same time they have fun, adventure and make friends along the way. They do this
  through taking part in a programme of activities provided by the Leadership team such as:
  camping, playing games, trying new things and exploring the outdoors.
