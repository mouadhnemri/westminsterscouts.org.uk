  Beavers
</h2>
<p>            
  Beaver Scouts are the youngest section of the Scouting family,
  who are usually aged between six and eight years old,
  though they can be as young as five and three quarters.
</p>
<p>
  Their activities are based around making things, outdoor activities, singing,
  playing games, going out on visits, investigating nature, listening to stories,
  learning how to be safe and most importantly, making new friends.
