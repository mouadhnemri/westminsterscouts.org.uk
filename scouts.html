<p>
  The Scout Section is for young people, usually aged between 10&frac12; and 14 years.
  A young person can come into the Troop at 10 and may stay until they are 14&frac12; years old.
  The Scout Troop is the third section in the Scout Group, above Beavers and Cubs.

  Scouts are the third section of the Scouting movement.
  From the first experimental camp for 20 boys in 1907,
  the movement now has an estimated 28 million members worldwide,
  and in the UK alone there are over 499,000 boys and girls involved in Scouting.
  An increase in adult volunteers means that more and more young people are now able to take part in their own big adventure.
