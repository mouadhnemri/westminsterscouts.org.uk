  Scouts

<p>
  The Scout Section is for young people, usually aged 10&frac12; - 14 years.
  A young person can come into the Troop at 10 and may stay until they are 14&frac12; years old.
  The Scout Troop is the third section in the Scout Group, above Beavers and Cubs.

  From the first experimental camp for 20 boys in 1907,
  the movement now has an estimated 28 million members worldwide,
  and in the UK alone there are over 400,000 boys and girls involved in Scouting.
  An increase in adult volunteers means that more and more young people are now able to take part in
  their own big adventure.
  See the <a href="scoutbadges">Scout Badges</a> for ideas on were our programme can take Scouts.
