            Scouting offers fun, challenge and everyday 
            adventure to 400,000 girls and boys across the 
            UK. Offering over 200 different activities from 
            abseiling and archery to drama, street sports and 
            water zorbing, Scouting helps 6-25 year olds 
            grow in confidence, achieve their full potential 
            and become active members of their communities.

            Beaver Scouts are the youngest section of the Scouting family,
            who are usually aged between six and eight years old,
            though they can be as young as five and three quarters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their activities are based around making things, outdoor activities, singing,
            playing games, going out on visits, investigating nature, listening to stories,
            learning how to be safe and most importantly, making new friends.

            Cubs take part in a wide range of activities that are designed to be interesting and to challenge 
            them. At the same time they have fun, adventure and make friends along the way. They do this 
            through taking part in a programme of activities provided by the Leadership team  such  as: 
            camping, playing games, trying new things and exploring the outdoors.

            The Scout Section is for young people, usually aged between 10&frac12; and 14 years.
            A young person can come into the Troop at 10 and may stay until they are 14&frac12; years old.

            Scouts are the third section of the Scouting movement.
            From the first experimental camp for 20 boys in 1907,
            the movement now has an estimated 28 million members worldwide,
            and in the UK alone there are over 499,000 boys and girls involved in Scouting.
            An increase in adult volunteers means that more and more young people are now able to take part in their own big adventure.
