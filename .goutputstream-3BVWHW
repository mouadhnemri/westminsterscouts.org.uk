          <p>
            Scouting offers fun, challenge and everyday 
            adventure to 400,000 girls and boys across the 
            UK. Offering over 200 different activities from 
            abseiling and archery to drama, street sports and 
            water zorbing, Scouting helps 6-25 year olds 
            grow in confidence, achieve their full potential 
            and become active members of their communities. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="purple subheading">Join</h2>
          <p>
            There are many ways you can kick-start your adventure,
            as a <a href="#">young person</a>, <a href="#">parent</a> or <a href="#">adult volunteer</a>.
            Our volunteers get involved on their terms and not all roles involve working with young people.
            If you can give a little time (or a lot) to help improve young lives in your community,
            <a href="#">we’d love to hear from you</a>.

            between seven years and six months and eight years six months.
